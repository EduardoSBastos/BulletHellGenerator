# BulletHellGenerator
A system to facilitate the generation of complex bullet hell bullet patterns.

This repository contains simple to use but versatile tool to facilitate the process of creating complex projectile patterns for bullet hell games.

The patters are creatied by instantiating a "Sequence" Scriptable Object, which contains all the information about a single bullet pattern, such as quantity, duration, speed and direction.

All these characteristics can be edited directly in the SO trough a cusom interface.

Objects on the scene that include the "Canon" monobehaviour can reference this 'Sequence' to start shooting once the canon is triggered.

Possibly the most powerfull feature of this tool is that one Sequence may reference another Sequence, accumulating their characteristics. This means that complex patters may be quickly and easily generated by concatenating two or more simple sequences.
