# BulletHellGenerator
A simple to use yet versatile tool to facilitate the generation of complex and varied projectile patterns. Usefull for any projectile intensive game, from Bullet Hells to Rougue Likes and Action Adventure games.

## About

The bullet patters are created by instantiating a **Sequence** Scriptable Object, which contains all the information about a single bullet pattern, such as quantity, duration, speed and direction.
All these characteristics can be edited directly in the SO trough a cusom interface.

Objects on the scene that include the **Canon** monobehaviour can reference a **Sequence**, and will start shooting upon triggering the **Canon**.

Possibly the most powerfull feature of this tool is that one **Sequence** may reference another **Sequence**, accumulating their characteristics. This means that complex patters may be quickly and easily generated by concatenating two or more simple **Sequences**.

## Current Status
